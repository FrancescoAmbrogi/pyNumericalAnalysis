Hello again! Welcome to the Differentiation module

In this module you will learn how to program a simple
finite difference scheme and understand its characteristics.
You will come to understand the difference between forward 
differences, central and backward. Also you will learn how
finite differences deal with noisy data.

In this module there is also MyDerivatives.py which is a tool
I develped to evaluate derivatives. Check it out and increase 
your python knowledge.

Once again my advice is: try by yourself and then check the 
solution.

This repo contains:
- Finite differences schemes (Forward, Backward, Central)
- Second order formula
- Difference between 2 point and 4 point formula in dealing with noisy data.

Enjoy!

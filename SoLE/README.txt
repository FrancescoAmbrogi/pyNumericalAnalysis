Hello! This folder contains the problems related 
to the topic "Solution to systems linear equations"
of the type Ax=b.

This is a particular important topic in Numerical
Analysis. My suggestion again is to try alone first
and then look at the solution.

The repo contains:
- Gauss elimination method
- Gauss elimination method with partial pivoting
- Gauss Jordan method
- Iterative Jacobi method
- Iterative Gauss Sidel method

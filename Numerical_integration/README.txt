Hello again! In this section you will find 
py routines belonging to the section: "Numerical Integration"
Finding the integral of a function between two values is 
like asking to evaluate the area under the curve 
given by those two values.

The repo contains:
- Trapezoidal rule
- 1/3 Simpson's rule
- Double integration

Example is taken from Elementary Numerical Analysis - Kendall
Example 5.1.1

Enjoy!

Hello, this is Francesco!

When I was studying from my Numerical Analysis exam (long time ago)
I wrote several routines to test numerical methods. I found it very
useful even if they are very simple.

Also, I made these routines when my knowledge of Python was very
limited. The "coding" is not the focusing point here, we want to 
understand how Numerical Methods work.

My advice: follow the structure of each folder, try first by
yourself to code the numerical method and then check the solution.

This repo contains:
- Simple iterative method to solve equations.
- Bisection method.
- Bisection method (regula falsi).
- Newton method.
- Secant method.

Enjoy!

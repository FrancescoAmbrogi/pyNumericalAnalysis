Hello, this is Francesco!

This folder contains excercises related to the topic
Root finding in numerical analysis.

My advice: follow the structure of each folder, try first by
yourself to code the numerical method and then check the solution.

This repo contains:
- Simple iterative method to solve equations.
- Bisection method.
- Bisection method (regula falsi).
- Newton method.
- Secant method.

The example solved is taken from:
Elementary Numerical Analysis - Kendall

Enjoy!

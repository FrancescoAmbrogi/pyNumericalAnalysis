Hello,

This project has the aim of helping whoever is entering
the world of Numerical Analysis for the first time.
The repo contains an undergraduate level set of problems
in Numerical Analysis.

Some of the concepts can be difficult to grasp at first,
but the main goal here is to understand what the 
numerical technique is really doing rather than learning
the programming language.

For this reason, I chose a very simple yet powerful 
programming language (Python) and every routine is 
written in a concise and easy way. Comments are 
included along the way.
